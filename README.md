Here you can find an information about my dog.
So, my dog's name is Graph. His breed is a Staffordshire pit bull terrier. He is 9 months old. 

Prehistory.

I've been wanting a dog for a long time. And when that moment came, I was looking forward to seeing him.I remember when I came to the nursery and Graph sat down next to me..

Some people consider this breed of dog "killers". In fact, these are stereotypes. It all depends on the dog's upbringing.

My dog is very kind and funny. Graph wags his long tail and tries to be friends with everyone. I love him
